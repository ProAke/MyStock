I give permission to use this code as you wish for your own applications. 

Install
-------
1. Upload the 'scan' folder to your webserver which will need php and mysql.
2. Edit the lib/config.php and set your mysql database details
3. edit the lib/product.php file and set your database serach query using the barcode value.
4. edit the index.php file to handle the specifics of your images field from the database.

Lastly, you can then install pic2shoppro

To make it work with your mobile phone.

Have fun
